## Chiropractic Help for StutteringThere are few things more intimidating – to both children than adults – than speaking with a stutter.  

An estimated 15 million people in the world are affected by stuttering. Although common for children to experience short-term stuttering, it is not “normal” if it is prolonged or is occurring after the age of five.  Some common signs that your child is struggling are: repetitions of whole words, increased prolongation of words, increased facial tension while speaking, vocal tension, fear/avoidance of speaking, avoiding certain words for fear of stuttering. These findings are interesting to note, because many times stuttering is thought of as a speech-related problem, when in fact it is a brain problem.  There is a miscommunication with the connection between the brain and the mouth; there is a problem with the sensory integration of the two.  For some reason, the nervous system is not communicating with the speech organs (mouth, tongue, lips) in a proper way and the person starts to stutter.  Misalignments to the spine can cause a problem with the flow of information from the brain to the body, and the body to the brain. By taking out the interference of the nervous system, the brain and body can work in proper unison again. Chiropratic help from Clinic 27 can help you on this journey.  

Chiropractic care works by improving the function of the nervous system.  When children get adjusted, they calm down, slow down, rest and fully process information. 

### How Chiropractic Care Can Help with Stuttering and Other Speech Impediments ?The temporal lobe is the part of your brain that is in charge of your speech. It’s located behind your ears, and if the cranial plate shifts, it can disturb the areas affecting speech.  

Adjusting the temporal cranial plate can reduce or eliminate the pressure on that area of the brain, resulting in proper brain function in these areas. It can get the brain communicating correctly with the body again and alleviate some of these issues with speech by allowing the brain to correctly process information. 

It isn’t only the cranial plate that might be causing issues. If the spine is out of alignment, the information your body is trying to send to the brain can get muddled. Eliminating this obstruction reopens those lines of communication and lets the body properly come together with the brain again. 

With everything properly aligned, the stutter is no longer the focus, allowing the individual to slow down and deal with information correctly and with less anxiety. 

### Tips for Parents If you’re the parent of a child who stutters, these tips may help: 

- Listen attentively to your child. Maintain natural eye contact when he or she speaks. 
- Wait for your child to say the word he or she is trying to say. Don’t jump in to complete the sentence or thought. 
- Set aside time when you can talk to your child without distractions. Mealtimes can provide a good opportunity for conversation. 

- Speak slowly, in an unhurried way. If you speak in this way, your child will often do the same, which may help decrease stuttering. 
- Take turns talking. Encourage everyone in your family to be a good listener and to take turns talking. 
- Strive for calm. Do your best to create a relaxed, calm atmosphere at home in which your child feels comfortable speaking freely. 
- Don’t focus on your child’s stuttering. Try not to draw attention to the stuttering during daily interactions. Don’t expose your child to situations that create a sense of urgency, pressure, or a need to rush or that require your child to speak in front of others. 
- Offer praise rather than criticism. It’s better to praise your child for speaking clearly than to draw attention to stuttering. If you do correct your child’s speech, do so in a gentle, positive way. 

- Accept your child just as he or she is. Don’t react negatively or criticise or punish your child for stuttering. This can add to feelings of insecurity and self-consciousness. Support and encouragement can make a big difference.
