Synovitis, transient synovitis, and tenosynovitis are all conditions that can cause pain and inflammation in the joints. While these conditions can be treated with medication or surgery, chiropractic care may also be an effective remedy. Chiropractic adjustments help reduce inflammation and pain by improving joint function and inflammation. In this article, we will discuss different types of joint and tendon inflammation, referred to as synovitis and tenosynovitis. 

## Synovitis, Tenosynovitis and Transient Synovitis Synovitis is a condition that results in the inflammation of the synovial membrane, which is the thin layer of tissue that surrounds the joints and helps to lubricate them. Synovitis can be caused by a number of different factors, including injury, infection, and autoimmune diseases. 

Transient synovitis is a type of synovitis that is typically short-lived and resolves itself.  

Tenosynovitis is another type of synovitis that affects the tendons and their surrounding sheaths.  

## Causes of Synovitis, Tenosynovitis and Transient Synovitis Synovitis, transient synovitis, and tenosynovitis are all conditions characterised by inflammation of the joint or tendon sheath. While these conditions are commonly caused by injury or infection, they can also be triggered by autoimmune disease and other long-term health conditions. Because the disorders can be difficult to diagnose, treatment often focuses on relieving pain and reducing inflammation. Common options include anti-inflammatory medications, physical therapy to strengthen the affected area, and corticosteroid injections to combat chronic inflammation. In certain cases, surgery may also be recommended in order to remove damaged tissue or repair ruptured tendons. Overall, there is no single approach that works for everyone; instead, different treatment options must be carefully tailored to each patient’s unique needs and symptoms. 

## DeQuervain’s Tenosynovitis  DeQuervain’s Tenosynovitis is a common type of tenosynovitis where an individual’s thumb and wrist pain refers up into their forearm. The condition is often caused by sedentary office work, texting, computer use, playing golf or racquet sports or engaging in activities that require repetitive hand or wrist movement. 

Tendons attach your muscles to your bones and are like springs in a human’s body. Tendons don’t like being stretched or compressed. Certain movements cause muscles to tighten, which then pulls tendons away from the bone. Prolonged stretching of tendons cause them to lose their elasticity or become inflamed (a condition known as tendinitis). DeQuervain’s Tenosynovitis is the inflammation of the sheath that surrounds the tendons themselves. Within the sheath that tendons go in and out of (which resembles a tunnel) there is a fluid that allows them to slide very comfortably. However excessive movement or use of the thumb causes tendons to swell and get thicker, and this results in a narrowing of the tunnel, thereby restricting easy movement and limiting your wrist’s range of motion. 

## Chiropractic Care for Synovitis, Tenosynovitis and Transient Synovitis Chiropractic care is an alternative form of medicine that focuses on the treatment and diagnosis of musculoskeletal disorders, and has been shown to be effective in reducing the inflammation and pain associated with synovitis, transient synovitis, and tenosynovitis, and restoring range of motion. 

A study published in the Journal of Manipulative and Physiological Therapeutics found that chiropractic adjustments were able to significantly reduce pain and improve function in patients with these conditions. The study participants who received chiropractic care also had a significantly lower risk of recurrence compared to those who did not receive chiropractic treatment. Another study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, found that chiropractic adjustments were able to reduce pain and improve range of motion in patients with shoulder impingement syndrome – another condition that can cause synovitis.  

The areas of the body affected by tenosynovitis, synovitis, and transient synovitis are somewhat complex. These conditions all result from inflammation of one or more joints or the surrounding connective tissues. Chiropractic treatments focus on these structures to help alleviate pain and restore optimal mobility. 

The main areas targeted in Chiropractic treatment include the muscles and tendons that support the joint, as well as other soft tissues in the area. This may involve massage therapy or other manual techniques to stimulate circulation, decrease muscle tension, and promote healing. In addition, Chiropractors may prescribe specialised exercises to stretch the affected tissues and strengthen the surrounding musculature. Through a combination of these methods, chiropractors can often alleviate symptoms and restore full function to patients suffering from tenosynovitis, synovitis, or transient synovitis. Treatment is very successful in the short term, and regular chiropractic care not only helps prevent the recurrence of symptoms, but long-term damage as well.  

## Conclusion If you are experiencing any of the symptoms mentioned earlier, please do not hesitate to reach out to Clinic 27, and let one of our skilled chiropractors put you on the path to a better quality of life with less discomfort from inflammation and pain.
