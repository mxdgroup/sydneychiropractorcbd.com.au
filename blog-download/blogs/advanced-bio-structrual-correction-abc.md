ABC™ recognises your body’s remarkable ability to heal itself, but sometimes it needs a little help. The focus of ABC is to assist the body in only those areas where it can’t correct itself. Our ABC™ chiropractors do this by examining your spine and narrowing down the precise points in your body where mechanical stress is taking place. ABC™ adjustment techniques are then used to release it.

Even the fittest and healthiest person accumulates injuries and physical imbalances through the wear and tear of daily life. And while your body has a range of corrective and protective mechanisms built into it, the accrual of tension and tissue means it’s not always able to self-correct.

Treatment using the ABC™ technique aims to help with the alleviation of pain, improving posture and helping to balance the body. This is achieved by removing mechanical stress from your body’s skeletal, muscular and tissue structures. Your body will also benefit from a greater capacity for self-correction when future injuries and physical ailments arise.  Our team will speak to you regarding your specific issues and devise a plan that is suitable to you, ensuring the best possible outcome under our care.
