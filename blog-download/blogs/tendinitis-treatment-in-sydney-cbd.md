Tendinitis is inflammation or irritation of a tendon, but this is very limited because there is little blood supply to the Achilles tendon. More appropriate descriptions are inflammation of the surrounding sheath or degeneration within the substance of the tendon. The condition causes pain and tenderness just outside a joint.

Signs and symptoms of tendinitis tend to occur at the point where a tendon attaches to a bone and typically include:

• Pain often described as a dull ache, especially when moving the affected limb or joint• Tenderness• Mild swelling

Most cases are successfully treated non-surgically, a formal physical therapy program may be of benefit. A person might benefit from a program of specific exercise designed to stretch and strengthen the affected muscle-tendon unit. A cast or brace to completely rest this area may be necessary. Most cases of tendinitis can be successfully treated with rest and physical therapy.
