Abdominal and pelvic pain can take many different forms, depending on the underlying causes. Some common causes of abdominal or pelvic pain include infections, traumas, digestive disorders, hormonal imbalances, and cancers. 

Often, the severity of pain is related to the severity of the underlying condition. For example, infection-related abdominal pain can be quite severe and may be accompanied by high fever or nausea and vomiting. Trauma-related pain is often very localised in nature, while digestive disorders that cause stomach cramping are typically mild to moderate in intensity. 

Some forms of abdominal or pelvic pain may present as a noticeable bulge in the abdomen or groin area. Ultimately, assessing the causes of abdominal or pelvic pain is an important first step towards finding the appropriate treatment options. Chiropratic care could help deal with this pain. 

## Types and Causes of Abdominal Pain Although most cases of abdominal pain are benign, the pain can occasionally be a sign of a more serious condition. Abdominal pain is felt anywhere in the area between the bottom of the ribs and the pelvis. The pain may be aching, stabbing, burning, twisting, cramping, dull or gnawing. It is important to be able to important to be able to identify different types of abdominal pain.  

A common type of abdominal pain people experience is cramping. This is often caused by gas or indigestion, lactose intolerance, diarrhoea or constipation. While cramping is usually not indicative of a serious problem, it can sometimes be a symptom of bowel obstruction or appendicitis, for which emergency medical attention will be called for.  

Abdominal pain can also be dull and constant. This is often due to constipation, irritable bowel syndrome, diverticulitis or stomach ulcers. However, it can also be a sign of renal failure or pancreatitis.  

Abdominal pain that is sharp and sudden is often due to muscle strain, gastritis, gastroenteritis and food poisoning. However, it can also indicate a more serious problem such as an intestinal obstruction or a tear in the lining of the abdomen. Therefore, abdominal pain can vary greatly in severity and cause. It is important to pay attention to other symptoms and seek medical help if the pain is severe or persists for more than a few days. 

## Types and Causes of Pelvic Pain  Various types of pelvic pain can afflict both men and women. Most commonly, pelvic pain refers to pain in the lower abdomen, below the navel. However, it can also refer to pain in the lower back, hips, or buttocks. Pelvic pain can be either acute or chronic. Acute pelvic pain comes on suddenly and is usually short-lived. Chronic pelvic pain, on the other hand, persists for weeks or even months at a time. Pelvic pain can have a variety of causes, from urinary tract infections to endometriosis. Some of the more serious causes of pelvic pain, which mainly affects women, are listed below: 

- Pelvic Congestion Syndrome (often accompanied by painful blood pooling and pelvic pressure); 
- Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (a sexually-transmitted infection that results in the inflammation of a woman’s reproductive organs, which if left untreated can lead to an ectopic pregnancy, infertility or cancer); 

- Ovarian Cysts; 
- Endometriosis (where endometrial tissue that grows inside the uterus grows outside the womb, and painfully breaks down with the menstrual cycle, causing inflammation and scarring); 
- Vulvodynia (a chronic condition affecting a woman’s outer genitals); 
- Appendicitis; 
- Bacterial Vaginosis; (a common vaginal infection treatable with the antibiotic clindamycin); 

- Pelvic Floor Tension Myalgia (chronic spasm in the muscles of the pelvic floor, characterised by pain in the lower abdomen, hips, coccyx and lumbosacral region) 

In some cases, the cause of pelvic pain cannot be determined. If you are experiencing pelvic pain, it is important to see a medical practitioner so that the cause can be properly diagnosed and treated.  

### Treatment Options   Treatments for abdominal and pelvic pain can vary widely depending on the underlying cause. For example, patients with injuries or inflammatory conditions may be prescribed pain medications or anti-inflammatory drugs to ease their discomfort. Patients with infections may require antibiotics or other types of antimicrobial therapy to clear up the source of the problem. In more severe cases, surgery may be used to repair tissue damage or remove blockages that are causing pain. Overall, successful management of abdominal and pelvic pain often requires an in-depth understanding of the underlying cause and careful monitoring of the response to different treatment options. 

## Chiropractic Care for Abdominal and Pelvic Pain Chiropractic treatments are often used to address a wide range of health conditions, including issues related to the abdominal and pelvic region. Spinal misalignments often cause pain and dysfunction in other parts of the body. Chiropractors are experts in the diagnosis and treatment of spinal misalignment and other musculoskeletal disorders. In fact, research has shown that spinal adjustments are more effective than standard medical care for treating abdominal and pelvic pain, irrespective of cause.  

## Abdominal and Pelvic Pain  – ConclusionBy adjusting the body’s alignment, chiropractors help to reduce pressure on sensitive nerves, allowing patients to experience relief from things like abdominal cramps, bloating, and pelvic pain. Furthermore, chiropractic adjustments can also improve blood flow to these areas, promoting better tissue repair and healing.
