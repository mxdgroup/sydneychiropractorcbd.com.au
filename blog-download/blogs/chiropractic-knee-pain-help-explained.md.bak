## What Can a Chiropractor do About Your Knee Pain?Knee pain is a common complaint among millions of adults. It usually pops up when you bend over and feel an acute stinging sensation, or pain while walking or jogging. At first, you may think it’s because of an old injury, “wear and tear”, or arthritis. The reality is that it could be anything from arthritis to an overstrained tendon. It’s virtually impossible to tell without a professional eye.

## What is Chronic Knee Pain and What Causes it?Chronic knee pain is long-term pain, swelling, or sensitivity in one or both knees. The cause of your knee pain can determine the symptoms you experience. And if you do suffer from this condition, you will need to seek pain relief treatment.  Many conditions can cause or contribute to chronic knee pain, and many treatments exist. Each person’s experience with chronic knee pain will be different.

Temporary knee pain is different from chronic knee pain. Many people experience temporary knee pain as a result of an injury or accident. Chronic knee pain rarely goes away without treatment, and it isn’t always attributable to one incident. It’s most often the result of several causes or conditions.

## Physical Conditions or Diseases Can Cause Knee Pain.  These include:

- osteoarthritis: pain, inflammation, and joint destruction caused by degeneration and deterioration of the joint
- tendinitis: pain in the front of the knee that is made worse when climbing, taking stairs, or walking up an incline
- bursitis: inflammation caused by repeated overuse or injury of the knee
- chondromalacia patella: damaged cartilage under the kneecap
- gout: arthritis caused by the buildup of uric acid
- Baker’s cyst: a buildup of synovial fluid (fluid that lubricates the joint) behind the knee
- rheumatoid arthritis (RA): a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder that causes painful swelling and can eventually cause joint deformity and bone erosion
- dislocation: dislocation of the kneecap most often the result of trauma
- meniscus tear: a rupture in one or more of the cartilage in the knee
- torn ligament: tear in one of the four ligaments in the knee — the most commonly injured ligament is the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)
- bone tumours: osteosarcoma(second most prevalent bone cancer), most commonly occurs in the knee

## Factors That May Make Chronic Knee Pain Worse:
- injuries to the structure of the knee can cause bleeding and swelling and can create a chronic problem over time if not treated properly
- sprains and strains
- overuse
- infection
- bad posture and form when doing physical activity
- not warming up or cooling down before or after physical activity
- improperly stretching the muscles

The joint and ligaments surrounding the knee need to be strong to provide support for all kinds of activities. When they’re compromised, localised pain is one of the first indicators that you need to seek help. Whatever the cause, nagging, chronic knee pain can make it hard to live your life.

This is where chiropractic care could come in. Many sufferers of ongoing knee pain are finding that through spinal alignments and complementary treatments, it’s possible to mitigate or eliminate localised pain naturally.

## Removing Painkillers from the EquationMany people mistakenly believe that only temporary solutions – such as Cortisone shots or prescription drugs – are the only way to treat knee pain. The reality is that chiropractic is a conservative, low-risk treatment plan that offers results without the nasty side effects of painkillers or the invasive approach of shots.

Chiropractic starts with an accurate, thorough diagnosis of your pain. Knee pain may be caused by osteoarthritis, a nagging injury, referred pain, or excessive weight. Ultimately, an examination and evaluation will determine the specific cause. Determining exactly what’s going on in your case is essential before deciding on a treatment program. Treating knee pain from arthritis may require a different approach than treating knee pain from a recent trauma.

## The Chiropractic Solution to Knee PainDepending on the cause of your knee pain, your chiropractor will create a targeted treatment plan designed for your individual condition. This helps to ensure that the right approach is being taken and that progress and results are measurable. 

The spine may be the root cause of the problem due to its multifaceted role in the central nervous system. Correcting spinal misalignments through adjustment is at the heart of chiropractic treatment.

Chiropractic can also provide hip and knee manipulation. This is important for mobilising the joints and reducing inflammation while testing range of motion.

A chiropractor may correct a patient’s posture to distribute body weight evenly, lessening the burden of stress on an affected knee.

Physical therapy can be useful to rehabilitate injury and help a patient lose weight. A chiropractor can prescribe targeted exercises along with nutritional advice to ensure long-term healing.

Complementary treatments can assist in alleviating stress, while improving the flow of nutrients to soft tissue.

Chiropractors aim to realign the spine back to health, eliminating nerve interference and addressing the source of pain, fatigue, and disease.

## Four Top Tips for Finding a Great Sydney CBD Chiropractor:
- Check out how long they’ve been in practice
- Do they have a professional clinic, reception, a proper functioning business, all that stuff. If they’re professional and they’ve been doing it for a while, chances are they’ve put the same effort into their skillset. If they’re a younger practitioner, make sure they have been mentored by experienced colleagues.
- They must empathise with you.
- Do they understand your pain points, or at least are they trying to? Do they have experience in the things that you’re seeking? If you’re a weekend-tennis tragic, have they asked you about this? Are they interested in your lifestyle and pressures? All these things that the research neglects, a great practitioner will use to figure out your problem and help you find a solution.
- They must believe that they are the best possible person to help you at that point in time. Now obviously, everyone will think they are best poised to help you, and that’s great. They should have opinions and express those to you in a sound and logical manner. They should be able to answer your questions. If they can’t, they should be secure enough to say they can’t and go and do some learning for you. The point is, sniff out indecision and hesitation and run from it like the plague!

## Results! That’s it.
- This is key! If the person you are looking for does not have a track history of getting results for their patients, then move on to the next candidate. That’s why word of mouth is still the best way to find the right fit for you.

In saying all of this, if you do find a great practitioner that is helping you, trust in them. See the value not only in that treatment that they are performing, but the years of education they have accumulated to bring you that result. They will get even better and more efficient at helping you as time progresses and they learn the intricacies of your body.
