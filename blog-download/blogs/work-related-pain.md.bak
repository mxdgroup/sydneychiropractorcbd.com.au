Work-related pain has long been a hindrance to efficient work performance among employees. Pain in the lower back and upper extremities are vital causes of morbidity in individuals and translate to a high economic cost to society. Chiropractic care from Clinic 27 could help you deal with this work-related pain effectively.

## Understanding Work-Related PainThe mismatch between physical and physiological factors of tissue load and tolerance causes structural damage and metabolic waste accumulation, leading to discomfort and pain. Some strains result from acute overexertion, causing direct damage to muscle fibres, ligaments, or tendons. This activates peripheral pain receptors through direct chemical or mechanical action.

Work-related pain is often accompanied by an escalating imbalance between work quality/quantity and individual resources. Workers exposed to repetitive, stressful exertion and awkward postures face an elevated risk of impaired workability and pain disorders. This impairment has been associated with productivity loss, early retirement, and high mortality rates.

Before managing these conditions, it’s essential to understand the work-related factors in their etiology. The primary factors inducing pain are force, posture, and repetition. Addressing these factors increases the chances of successful back pain treatment and rehabilitation.

## Common Work-Related Pain ConditionsBack Pain: Back pain is one of the most common work-related issues, causing high rates of employee absence. It can result from inappropriate posture while working or lifting objects, or simply sitting without activity for extended periods. Jobs requiring long hours of sitting in front of screens are particularly prone to causing back pain.

Tech Neck: Neck pain often correlates with poor posture, repetitive strain, muscle injury, or job stress. Prolonged periods of typing or working at a desk can cause neck tightness and muscle pain. Symptoms may include generalized shoulder pain, lower neck and upper back pain, sharp localized pain, headaches, reduced neck mobility, and jaw pain due to cervical spine misalignment.

Shoulder Pain: Occupational shoulder pain is often associated with stress-inducing, repetitive work, especially when performed above shoulder height. This provides a biomechanically plausible mechanism for most of the pain experienced. In some cases, more forceful activity or weakened tendons due to degeneration can lead to tears.

Shoulder Pain in The Left Side: Left-side shoulder pain can be particularly concerning as it may be mistaken for heart-related issues. However, it’s often musculoskeletal in nature, caused by poor posture, overuse injuries, referred pain from neck or upper back issues, or unfavorable sleeping positions. Persistent left shoulder pain, especially if accompanied by chest pain or shortness of breath, requires immediate medical attention to rule out cardiovascular concerns.

Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS): CTS results from compression of the median nerve at the wrist. It’s caused by repetitive, forceful hand and wrist movements, prolonged use of vibrating tools, or specific wrist anatomy and hand use patterns. Symptoms include sensory changes, tingling, numbness, pain, and potential wasting of the thumb base muscle. CTS is typically treatable with chiropractic care and usually resolves within months.

Other Work-Related Pain Issues: People working in warehouses, factories, and assembly lines often develop subluxations from extensive repetitive movements or prolonged sitting/standing. These can lead to tension, stiffness, pain, and fatigue, significantly impacting quality of life and daily task performance.

Poor posture, such as prolonged hunching while sitting or standing, can cause pain in the back, core, and abdomen. This may result in stiffness and discomfort in the shoulders or lower back as the spine bears excessive stress.

## Role of Chiropractic in Relieving Work-Related PainChiropractic is a systemic therapy focused on the neuroskeletal structure of the body, particularly the spine. Chiropractors work by manipulating the body’s alignment to relieve pain and improve functional and healing abilities. While spinal manipulation is the mainstay of chiropractic, treatment may also include postural exercises and ergonomic training.

Chiropractic care has proven highly effective in treating work-related low back and neck pain. Spinal manipulation, a hands-on approach to adjust spinal structures and restore mobility, has shown superior results in returning individuals to work compared to other treatments like medical care or physical therapy.

Studies have demonstrated that chiropractic treatment approaches have prolonged effects. Patients choosing chiropractic care for work-related pain management were less likely to miss work and more likely to be productive. Research on laborers with back or neck pain revealed that those receiving chiropractic care experienced faster recovery and more comprehensive pain relief.

Compared to most other physical therapies, chiropractic care for work-related lower back pain results in fewer surgeries, consistently better outcomes, reduced painkiller usage, lower pain recurrence, and lower medical costs.

## Addressing the Rising Trend of Work-Related PainRecent observations indicate a significant increase in work-related pain issues, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic and the shift to remote work. Young professionals in their early to late 20s are increasingly experiencing neck pain and shoulder pain due to long hours at desks and poor home office setups. This trend underscores the importance of proper ergonomics and regular breaks, even for those early in their careers.

To minimize the risk of developing work-related pain, it’s crucial to maintain good posture, take regular breaks for stretching and movement, set up an ergonomic workspace, engage in regular exercise to strengthen core and back muscles, practice stress-reduction techniques, and seek early intervention at the onset of pain.
