What is good posture anyway and why is it so critical? Essentially posture refers to the body’s alignment and positioning with respect to the force of gravity. Whether we are standing, sitting or resting gravity applies a force on our joints, ligaments and muscles. Good posture involves distributing the power of gravity through our body so that it won’t be over-stressed.

Good posture equals good health and great wellbeing. Research shows that slumping or walking with your head bowed forward decreases your air supply and ups the danger of dying prematurely.

Here at Clinic 27 we will teach you why great stance is imperative for several reasons. It lessens muscle strain. For example if you are sitting hunched over a desk, the back of your neck gets tight and sore. Good posture positions you in balance helping you move with more ease. Also, remember that great stance helps you look incredible. Proper posture is also important in order to keep our body running at peak efficiency. If we develop postural imbalances, our joints will be unable to experience their full scope of movement. After some time, this would diminish the amount of muscle activation, strength and cause extra anxieties to our bodies.

One of the many reasons why you need to take great consideration of your posture is because it helps keep your body in proper alignment. Over time, poor posture can bring about various issues that influence your musculoskeletal framework. In particular, it will cause a change in the resting length of muscles. When muscles and joints don’t function optimally, the result is usually pain and injury. Poor stance is additionally connected with decreased energy levels. Typically, people who are confident in themselves exhibit good, tall posture. Additionally, poor posture will also carry over into your health and fitness regimen. You are unlikely to exhibit safe, proper weight training mechanics if your posture is compromised.

Changing your posture isn’t going to occur without any forethought. It took years to build up the propensity for slumping, so it is inevitably going to take some time and discipline. Each time you get to be aware of your slumping, immediately correct it. Sit up tall with your neck long and your shoulders down and back. You may find that sitting with proper stance causes the muscles in your low back to burn and fatigue. This is on the grounds that they are deconditioned because of years of not needing to stay activated for long periods of time. Continue working at it however, a little change in stance could mean enormous changes in different parts of your life!

Not maintaining good stance and adequate back support can add strain to muscles and put stress on the spine. After some time, the stress of poor posture can change the anatomical characteristics of the spine, leading to the possibility of constricted blood vessels and nerves.
