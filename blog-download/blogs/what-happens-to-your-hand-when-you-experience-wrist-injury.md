There are various wounds that may happen in a competitor’s hands or wrists. They can be grouped into two principle classes: traumatic (intense) and abuse (perpetual). Traumatic wounds will probably happen in competitors who partake in games that require more elevated amounts of contact (i.e., football, hockey or wrestling), while abuse wounds result in competitors who take an interest in games that oblige them to “overcompensate” a specific development (i.e., baseball, tennis, or golf). Some normal traumatic wounds in competitors incorporate joint disengagements, sprains, muscle strains, broken bones, tendon irritation, and ligament tears.

#### Crack Damage

The most widely recognized crack damage in the athletic populace happens in the fingers. Abuse wounds are anxiety actuated and incorporate tendon aggravation and separation, nerve harm, and overuse anxiety breaks. Long haul handicap is less inclined to happen from abuse wounds than from traumatic wounds. Be that as it may, if left untreated, a competitor’s games execution may be altogether decreased. Surgical treatment may be required if a damage holds on.

#### Symptoms:

Should you sustain a hand or wrist injury while participating in a game where an attending team physician is not present, seek immediate medical care if any of the following symptoms are present:

- Severe pain
- Severe swelling
- Numbness
- Coldness or grayness in the finger, hand, or wrist
- Abnormal twisting or bending of the finger or hand
