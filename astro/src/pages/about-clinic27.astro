        ["The team at Clinic 27 is dedicated to the provision of chiropractic care with a difference, helping business professionals achieve their health care goals and maintain a high level of wellbeing.",
        "Clinic 27 is one of only a handful of Australian clinics to promote Advanced Biostructural Correction (ABC™). This technique reverses the effects of the body's natural compensation for old injuries and physical trauma and provides a long-term solution to pain and discomfort. We can help you manage a range of injuries and illness, and can reduce or rid you of your pain and discomfort. We work treating neck and back pain, poor posture, sciatica, headaches and general lack of energy. We design a personalised posture correction plan to meet your needs and work with you to take charge of pain and your long-term health.",
        "Our goal in this practice is to help you understand the source and nature of chronic pain and explain how you can mindfully locate and identify the cause of stress in your body. We look at how standing, sitting and sleeping can affect your habitual posture, and we will aim to uncover the breakthrough technique that brings results that were previously out of reach. When used with care and attention to diet and lifestyle, the results are unimaginable.",
        "We are now offering TMJ/Cranial chiropractic care alongside our usual chiropractic services."
