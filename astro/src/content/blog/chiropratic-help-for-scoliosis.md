## Scoliosis Condition
Early detection can improve The likelihood of correction.  

## Can it be Prevented?  
Scoliosis is tragic. It causes both physical pain and emotional suffering. This sideways bending of the spine shows up as abnormal posture and then finally, deformity. If allowed to advance, it can interfere with the lungs, heart and many other vital organs.  Chiropractic care from Clinic 27 should be your go to place for chiropractic care. 

There is hope.  

Scoliosis affects boys, but more frequently girls, between the ages of 8 and 18. The cause varies. Some are born with this spinal deviation (congenital). Others get it from assuming a distorted head or hip position (habitual). Sadly, in many cases the cause is still unknown.  

Clothing that doesn’t fit correctly can be an early sign of scoliosis.  

In the beginning, when it is easiest to correct, there are rarely symptoms. However, an alert parent may notice that a high shoulder or low hip makes clothing fit poorly. Back and leg pains may develop but are often overlooked as merely “growing pains”. Neglect is the biggest danger.  

Make sure your children use both straps on their backpacks and their load doesn’t exceed 15% of their body weight.  

Some theorise that using devices that hasten early walking may interrupt the crawling stage,  essential for proper spinal development.  

If allowed to run its course, scoliosis can steadily worsen. Early detection is critical. Severe cases can involve surgery. This procedure attaches steel rods to the spine to force it to straighten.  

Chiropractic care has helped many young women avoid the unhappy effects of scoliosis. The procedure is simple.  

Surgical intervention often involved bolting a steel rod to the child’s spinal column. 

First, a thorough examination helps detect scoliosis in its early stage. Then, corrective action can begin at once. The primary course of care is a programme of specific chiropractic adjustments. These help improve the function and structure of the spine. Muscles strengthen. Posture can improve.  

Chiropractic care has helped countless young women reclaim their health, posture and their self-esteem.  

## Isn’t a certain amount of sideways curvature normal?  
Any type of sideways curvature is abnormal. From the back, the spine should appear straight. When scoliosis is present, there are usually two curves: a primary curve in one direction and a compensatory curve in the opposite direction.  

## Does a lack of calcium or carrying a heavy book bag cause scoliosis?  
No. However, there are a growing number of authorities who believe uncorrected spinal damage from the birth process may be involved. Others suggest that using walkers to encourage early walking may be a culprit.  

## What’s the best time for a scoliosis examination?  
As with the case of many health problems, early detection can improve the likelihood of correction. Wise parents consult our office soon after the birth of their child. Then they follow up with periodic chiropractic checkups throughout their child’s developing years.
