ABC chiropractic technique recognises your body’s remarkable ability to heal itself, but sometimes it needs a little help. The focus of ABC is to assist the body in only those areas where it can’t correct itself. Our ABC chiropractors do this by examining your spine, and narrowing down the precise points in your body where mechanical stress is taking place. ABC adjustment techniques, are then used to release it. 

Even the fittest and healthiest person accumulates injuries and physical imbalances through the wear and tear of daily life. And while your body has a range of corrective and protective mechanisms built into it, the accrual of tension and tissue means it’s not always able to self- correct. 

Treatment using the chiro ABC technique aims to help with the alleviation of pain, improving posture and helping to balance the body. This is achieved by removing mechanical stress from your body’s skeletal, muscular and tissue structures. Your body will also benefit from a greater capacity for self-correction when future injuries and physical ailments arise. Our team will speak to you regarding your specific issues and devise a plan that is suitable to you, ensuring the best possible outcome under our care.

## ABC Treatment for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome

Carpal Tunnel Syndrome is a common ailment for many people; the prevalence in women is up to three times more likely. Females generally have a smaller carpal tunnel, a narrow passageway in the wrist, which opens into the hand. This tunnel has the bones within the wrist beneath it and a special nerve known as the median nerve runs through this area. When there is pressure on the large median nerve this can cause irritation, numbness and sometimes pain which is commonly associated with the condition. 

The non-surgical treatments include: lots of rest for the affected hand, chiropractic treatments & physiotherapy, wearing a splint on the wrist and hand at night, diuretic medications to reduce fluid retention within the body, and corticosteroid injections to reduce the swelling. 

It is usually advisable to seek out non-surgical treatments for such things as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, as surgery is best left as a last resort. The compression of the nerve does not always happen at the wrist, as nerve roots are located at the spinal cord near the lower part of the neck. Treatment of the spinal cord, can, therefore, sometimes alleviate the condition. Less invasive treatments like chiropractic joint manipulation or mobilisation, stretching, and massage can be effective. In some instances, hand and wrist pain are not Carpal Tunnel Syndrome at all, but caused by something else, and may respond to spinal, tendon and joint therapy treatments. 

## ABC Treatment for Vertigo

Vertigo can affect many people for a variety of different reasons. Whether the condition is chronic or stems from the onset of migraine headaches, vertigo is an unpleasant sensation that makes the most basic of daily tasks difficult to bear. 

So what causes vertigo, exactly? In many cases vertigo can be caused by an issue with the inner ear. If the function in this area is not working as the body expects it can lead to imbalance that may inhibit standing, sitting or functioning comfortably in an upright motion. Some of the most common causes of vertigo are: 

• Meniere’s disease – A build-up of fluid and changing pressure in the inner ear leads to this disorder 

• BPPV – Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo is caused by the build-up of small calcium particles in the inner ear canal 

• Vestibular neuritis – An inner ear disorder usually caused by an infection 

• Stroke 

• Brain tumour 

• Neck injury 

• Back injury 

• Migraines 

• Certain medications

Unfortunately, the causes of vertigo are many, which makes vertigo treatment all that much trickier. Trained Chiropractors who treat vertigo, can be found in our Sydney city clinic. A consultation with our team is recommended for this disorder so that we may understand the cause and treat it accordingly. 

Vertigo can be an uncomfortable feeling that gives off the sensation of a lack of balance. As such, many sufferers will have a difficult time sitting or standing upright. The most common symptoms are: 

• Nausea 

• Tilting 

• Lack of balance 

• Sweating 

• Headaches or migraines 

• Jerking eye movements 

• Hearing Loss

 To best target the symptoms and the vertigo itself, rehabilitation is a necessary vertigo treatment. A chiropractor can hone in on the actual cause of the vertigo in order to tackle the pressure points that might be exacerbating the issue. Unlike medications and other invasive treatments, a chiropractor can help you find a solution purely by understanding the overall functioning of your body. 

As such, our chiropractors at Clinic 27 may have the chiropractor ABC vertigo solution for you. We can assess your condition and target the pressure points that are causing your vertigo. Regular therapy will ensure relief and long-term recovery from the condition. 

Although many doctors prescribe medications for the treatment of vertigo, there are less invasive therapies available to tackle the condition. In fact, the chiropractic team at Clinic 27 has helped many vertigo sufferers. If you suffer from vertigo, find out if we may be able to provide you with relief. 

## ABC Treatment for Scoliosis

Many people worldwide are affected by an unfortunate condition of the spine called Scoliosis. Essentially it details a curvature of the spine, scoliosis can cause pain and discomfort to those who are afflicted with the condition. 

Unfortunately, this often makes daily life a struggle due to the pain and difficulties scoliosis sufferers face when they walk, sit or partake in any activities. We, at Clinic 27, are a group of trained chiropractors who strive to help people suffering from this crippling condition. We can apply non-invasive methods like the ABC method to provide relief of the pains and symptoms associated to the condition. 

Scoliosis consists of a curvature of the spine, caused by many different factors. The different types of scoliosis are: 

• Congenital scoliosis – This is caused by a bone abnormality at birth. 

• Neuromuscular scoliosis – Resulting from paralysis, this type of scoliosis is specifically cause by abnormal muscles or nerves. 

• Degenerative scoliosis – This type is due to degenerative bone disease, extreme surgery or severe back trauma. 

- Idiopathic scoliosis – This is considered the most common type of scoliosis and no clear identifiable cause has been found. Scoliosis is detected through X-Ray screenings and two of the most common treatments for the condition consist of the use of braces and invasive surgery. 

Using the Advanced Bio structural Correction (ABC) Method, a Scoliosis chiropractor will hone in on the specific places in the spine where the condition is at its worst. Small movements will then be applied to manipulate tension areas to help realign the spine. With frequent therapy sessions, the patient may see significant improvements in their overall movements, energy levels and spinal alignment. We have seen the successful recovery of many scoliosis sufferers due to our treatment, which is the most non-invasive method available in the medical field today. Individual results may vary and we suggest you make an appointment with our Chiropractor team today to discuss your specific case and see if we too may be able to help you. 

## ABC Treatment for Sciatica

Sciatica sufferers carry the burden of exhausting leg pain on a daily basis. Directly affecting the sciatic nerve, the largest nerve in the body, it is a condition that must be treated with care and attention. Unfortunately, sufferers of this crippling condition can go years without proper treatment, affecting their quality of living overall. 

The ABC practitioner team at Clinic 27 strives to tackle sciatica with non-invasive therapies. Many patients have consulted our team of Chiropractors when other treatments have been of limited or no effect and found our treatments to look at the body as a whole rather than a specific area which may have a better outcome for their case. 

Sciatica can affect many people from all walks of life, it is often caused by a spinal disc herniation and other disc-related issues. This herniation is usually the cause of age-related degeneration due to injuries incurred. With time, sciatica can worsen and have negative consequences on a person’s quality of life. 

Sciatic pain can make it difficult to sleep and walk; sciatica is a debilitating condition that requires extra attention and care when treating it. The pain is usually described as a sharp shooting type, stemming from below the knee all the way down to the foot. This level of inflammation can persist for years and worsen if the area is not treated with regular therapy and care. 

An experienced sciatica chiropractor can assess such a medical condition, understanding the reasons for its initial onset and the ways to prevent aggravating it further. Our team of Chiropractors at Clinic 27 are trained to diagnose and make recommendations specific to these conditions. Our chiropractors will look at your spine, to see the issues and the injuries it is unable to correct on its own. Using a series of Chiropractic adjustments following the Advanced Bio structural Correction Method, the chiropractor may make small corrections to your spine in order to change the alignment of the body. 

Being able to enjoy outdoor activities or go out for a simple walk without pain will directly improve a patient’s quality of life and we may be able to provide you the necessary treatment to help you achieve this. If you or someone you know is in need of a treatment for sciatica, then it’s time for you to give the team at Clinic 27 a call today.

## ABC Treatment for Pregnancy

Pregnancy may be one of the most trying times in a woman’s life. The extra weight can be taxing on a woman’s body, requiring additional care and attention. In fact, chiropractors are highly sought after by pregnant women, as they are capable of honing in on particular pressure spots that are causing incredible strain and ensure that she is on her way to a safe and healthy pregnancy. 

The team at Clinic 27 are a group of chiropractors in Australia who all have ample experience working with pregnant mothers experiencing pregnancy pain. Having provided many pregnant women with relief, our team may be able to provide you with chiropractic care. 

A chiropractor may be able to help align the pelvic area and ensure that the baby is growing in the safest and healthiest environment possible. Ultimately, this alignment ensures that the body is working properly and prevents any unnecessary damage or harm. 

## ABC Treatment for Posture

With the majority of people glued to their computers on a daily basis, poor posture has become an increasingly significant problem. Poor posture can lead to debilitating backaches, sore necks and long-term spinal issues. 

Unfortunately, many people are unaware of their posture problems and let the issue worsen with time without an appropriate treatment or therapy in place. The team at Clinic 27 aims to help the people of Australia in developing better posture. We have given people the tools, tricks and therapies needed to identify their posture and ensure that they aren’t causing their body’s long-term damage. 

Slouching over computers, mobile phones and other gadgets has directly affected the posture of many of us relying on these technologies on a daily basis. Not only does poor posture lead to backaches and neck pain, but it also impacts the general health and wellbeing of those affected. A bad posture may lead to a lack of confidence as well, making one feel less comfortable in their own skin. 

Trained professionals in the matter may help realign the spine and work closely with the patient in understanding the reasons their posture was affected in the first place. This means that your chiropractor may be able to help you find tactics to prevent a poor posture in the future as well. 

Posture treatment will then work with the aim that no further strain is placed on the spine, as a posture chiropractor can develop a clear plan of action for the patient to follow in order to maintain the alignment within. 

Our attention to detail, careful assessment of individual situations and chiropractic sessions are designed to keep you upright and may help your spine long term. 

It’s often difficult to maintain an upright posture when our jobs and daily lives demand otherwise. With the help of our team, we aim to keep you on track and avoid getting back to a place where poor posture affected your life. 

## ABC Treatment for Neck Pain 

These days, many of us find ourselves overextending our necks due to the slouching position we often make when we work with our computers or use our mobile phones. This often causes debilitating neck pain that will make it difficult to get through a productive day. 

The team at Clinic 27 strives to help individuals suffering from neck pain by finding solutions that target the root of the condition. If you or someone you know is tolerating a level of neck pain that should require treatment, then give us a call today and see if we may be able to provide them with a solution. 

The neck is one of the most delicate parts of the human body, often prone to injury and pain. Consisting of vertebrae that extend the upper torso and the skull, the neck supports the head and its associated motions. The muscles, bones and nerves involved in this support can often get inflamed and cause severe pain to the individual. 

Although this pain can be caused by obvious injury, simple motions such as bad posture and overuse can also exacerbate the pain. This directly affects the afflicted individual in their daily lives making work, play or sleep an arduous activity that causes strain. In order to alleviate the symptoms of neck pain, and the injury itself, a trained neck pain chiropractor is required to assess and treat the condition. 

A professional can best understand the injury in order to put forth a plan of action that will ensure rehabilitation and a realignment of the area. The trained Chiropractors at Clinic 27 have treated many cases of neck pain, which have allowed us to develop an efficient and successful strategy for tackling the condition. Give our team at Clinic 27 a call today to see if our strategy may be right for you. 

The damage created by neck pain can be taxing on the body, impacting your overall functioning in ways that can be harmful in the long-term. Our practitioners use a specific technique method called Advanced Bio structural Correction (ABC) to target specific tension areas that are causing the pain. 

The ABC Method has been named as one of the best neck pain remedies on the market today, having led many individuals to long-term recovery. If you are in need of an effective strategy to deal with the pain that is preventing you from living a normal life, then let our Chiropractors help you. 

## ABC Treatment for Headaches and Migraines

Millions of people in the world suffer from headaches and migraines. Accidents, injuries, diets, insomnia and stressful lives are some of the leading causes of these debilitating conditions, making everyday life that much harder to manage. 

Migraines and headaches can cause symptoms such as throbbing sensations on one side of the head, often accompanied by symptoms of nausea and impaired vision. It is believed that genetics and environmental factors play a role in the onset of headaches or migraines, speaking to imbalances in brain chemicals and hormones. 

Whatever the cause, the pain is real and can often be excessive, preventing people from partaking in activities of daily living. With the onset of nausea or impaired vision, headaches can be more than a simple painful sensation. As such, many Australians are searching for headache and migraine treatment to help them get on with their day as healthily as possible. 

Are you looking to get on top of your headaches and migraines? Then give the team at Clinic 27 a call today – Tel: (02) 8059 7743. We look forward to helping you lead a happier and healthier life. 

## What you can expect from ABC Chiropractic Technique

We are among the first Australian practices to use this unique chiropractic technique which removes mechanical stress from your body’s skeletal, muscular and tissue structures.

We provide POST-TREATMENT-CARE. We always follow up with you over the telephone after your first treatment to check on your progress and answer any further questions you might have. 

We can show you YOUR PROGRESS.

From your first appointment, we start taking a series of photographs that map your treatment journey. You will be able to literally see the physical changes taking place in your body and know that you’re reaching your goals. 

Our CARE PLANS are tailored to fit you. No two clients are alike and that’s why every personalised treatment plan we develop is different. We’ll construct a plan that is responsive to your lifestyle and health care goals based on an overall picture of how you live. 

Our care plans are HOLISTIC. Pain and discomfort might be physical sensations, but they’re often the result of a complex mix of factors which include mental and emotional stresses. That’s why the development of your personalised treatment plan doesn’t look only at your body. We examine your life from a holistic perspective, incorporating your age, diet, the type of work you do, exercise regime, the amount of stress in your life, and any previous injuries and illnesses you’ve experienced. 

YOU TAKE CHARGE OF YOUR HEALTH. Good chiropractic treatment shouldn’t end when your appointment finishes. We will teach you to incorporate improved posture and better health practices into your daily lifestyle. 

WE’RE FAMILY FRIENDLY Chiropractic care isn’t an adults-only affair! Children may benefit from regular adjustments to help their bodies as they rapidly grow and develop. We have extensive experience working with children and can develop suitable treatment plans for your entire family.

We focus on long-term results At Clinic 27, we’re focused on identifying the root cause of your pain and discomfort, rather than just treating the immediate symptoms. 

## Is ABC Chiropractic Treatment Painful?

No! Our treatments are designed to specifically correct the areas of your spine that your body cannot self-correct. Treating or adjusting your spine should not hurt. Most patient’s feel an almost immediate improvement in symptoms, and if there is any discomfort it usually is mild and delayed – similar to what you might feel in your body after a tough work out in the gym. 

## What is the “crack” noise when I receive an adjustment?

When the spine is adjusted to correct the body in a way it cannot self-correct, you may hear a “cracking” noise. The noise when you receive an adjustment is simply gas within your joint being released. A Chiropractic treatment does not aim to release the gas, it is merely a side effect of little to no clinical consequence. Some adjustments don’t make any noise at all. 

## Are adjustments safe?

While there are always risks associated with any procedure, we minimise the risk through our thorough history, examination and testing as well as using specific gentle techniques. We will always discuss any risks with you before proceeding with care. No two cases are the same, therefore we tailor our treatment modality to make sure we deliver the best in Chiropractic care that is both safe and effective. 

## Once you start chiropractic care, do you have to keep going back?

You always get to decide whether you want to continue with the benefits of Chiropractic care. Many people chose to continue to get adjusted as they enjoy the ongoing benefits of a living a pain free life, as well as a healthy spine and nervous system. We will always give you our best advice with your care, based on your goals and what your specific objective results show. 

## Are Chiropractors university-trained?

Yes, all Chiropractors in Australia complete a minimum 5 year University qualification. They are registered through AHPRA, the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Authority and governed by the National Registration Board. Our Chiropractors at Clinic 27 complete studies in Anatomy, Physiology, Neurology, Orthopaedics, Radiology, Pathology and Chiropractic Diagnosis and skills. Our Chiropractors also complete compulsory continuing education. 

## Do I have to have x-rays?

If your chiropractor sees it to be necessary – they will refer you for X-rays if clinically indicated. There are certain conditions that will preclude you from having X-rays such as Pregnancy. If you have any concerns with taking X-ray images your chiropractor at Clinic 27 will be happy to discuss this with you further. 

## How long does it take?

This part is largely down to you, and depends on the severity of your condition and your longer-term health goals. You will see changes in your posture and condition after your very first adjustment by our Sydney CBD chiropractors at Clinic 27, but our philosophy isn’t just focused on alleviating short-term pain. It’s about getting your body into a state of balance and keeping it there so you experience real change to your quality of life. 

Although many patients come to us seeking a quick solution for their pain, most opt to continue through the posture correction and unwinding phases due to the changes they start seeing in their physical and mental well-being.
