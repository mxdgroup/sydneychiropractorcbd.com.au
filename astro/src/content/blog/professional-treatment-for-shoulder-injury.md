The shoulder is one of the most complex regions in the human body. Its movement involves several muscle groups, comprising dozens of muscles and joints. Any disruption or damage to these structures can result in pain throughout the shoulder girdle. Moreover, many painful conditions in the shoulder can also stem from nerve and vascular injuries or impingements in the neck, upper back, ribcage, and shoulder support area.

## Understanding Shoulder Anatomy

The shoulder girdle primarily consists of the scapula (shoulder blade) and the clavicle (collarbone), which move together as a unit. The shoulder girdle muscles are those that attach to and move these two bones. These muscles play a crucial role in shoulder function and stability.

## Common Symptoms of Shoulder Injury

When seeking to alleviate shoulder pain, it’s important to recognize the common symptoms of shoulder injuries:

- Swelling and tenderness in the neck or shoulder area

- Radiating ache

- Difficulty coughing or breathing deeply

- Presence of a mass in the neck or shoulder region

- Fever (in cases of infection)

## Professional Treatment Approaches

Successful treatment to provide shoulder pain relief truly depends on an accurate diagnosis from your healthcare provider. Identifying the precise cause of the pain is the most fundamental step in correcting and eliminating shoulder discomfort.

It’s important to note that discomfort in the anterior chest area can be referred pain from:

- Cardiovascular areas, such as the heart

- Respiratory system, including the lungs

- Digestive system, like the gastrointestinal tract

- Cervical spine (neck) issues

Shoulder pain itself doesn’t typically refer to the upper chest wall. However, there are a significant number of nerves around the pectoralis major tendon that originate from the neck area and travel behind the clavicle on their way down to the forearm along the chest wall. These may be spine-related issues. Given this rich network of nerves travelling behind the coracoid and pectoralis minor, it’s understandable how pain in this region can result from referred pain.
