Around the world millions of people are injured every year in vehicle accidents, we regularly ask patients whether they’ve been involved in a crash, no matter how small. If they have, addressing that issue first and foremost can keep your quality of life from being compromised months, years, or even decades later. Numerous studies have shown that years after whiplash victims settle their insurance claims, roughly half of them state that they still suffer with symptoms from their injuries.

Whiplash injuries need to be taken very seriously, particularly if you have been involved in a car accident. Symptoms of a whiplash injury can take weeks or months to manifest. It is easy to be fooled into thinking that you are not as injured as you really are. Chiropractic care can really help.

Too often people don’t seek treatment following a car accident because they don’t feel hurt. By far, the most common injury to the neck is a whiplash injury. Whiplash is caused by a sudden movement of the head, either backward, forward, or sideways. This can result in damage to the supporting muscles, ligaments and other connective tissues in the neck and upper back.

Unfortunately, by the time more serious complications develop, some of the damage from the car accident injuries may have become permanent. Numerous studies have shown that years after whiplash victims settle their insurance claims, roughly half of them state that they still suffer with symptoms from their injuries. If you have been in an auto accident or any other kind of accident, don’t assume you escaped injury if you are not currently in pain.

A Chiropractor is a health care provider who focuses on the musculoskeletal system including your spine and the delicate nervous system and they have the chiropractor treatment tools to help the body do what it does best – heal itself.
