The word “scoliosis” often brings concern, but understanding this condition is the first step toward effective management. Scoliosis is characterised by a sideways curvature of the spine, presenting either as a “C”-shape or an “S”-shaped curve. While many people have subtle spinal curves, a formal scoliosis diagnosis occurs when the Cobb’s angle on x-ray measures more than 10 degrees.

At Complete Chiropractic, our team has built a strong reputation for improving upright posture through the Advanced Biostructural Correction method. Many of our clients experience significant reductions in their spine’s sideways curvature through this approach.

## Early Detection and Intervention
One crucial aspect of scoliosis management is timing. Conservative care can begin at any age, but early intervention is ideal, particularly before adolescent growth spurts. During these periods of rapid growth, scoliosis can develop quickly and often without obvious pain or symptoms. This is why regular screening and early detection play vital roles in successful treatment outcomes.While scoliosis is traditionally viewed as a musculoskeletal condition, recent research has revealed a fascinating neurological component.

Current studies suggest several potential causes:

- Brain asymmetry

- Neural axis deformities

- Abnormal sensorimotor integration (communication between brain and body)

This neurological aspect makes chiropractic care uniquely positioned to help manage scoliosis. The brain and nerves control and organise muscle function, and any miscommunication in this system can lead to abnormal postural tone and potentially contribute to spinal deformities, including scoliosis.The scoliosis treatment goes beyond simple spinal manipulation. Research has demonstrated that spinal adjustments increase brain activity in the sensorimotor cortex compared to both pre-adjustment states and control groups.

 ## The Role of Advanced Biostructural Correction
Our team’s expertise in Advanced Biostructural Correction has proven particularly effective in improving upright posture. This method provides a systematic approach to addressing postural irregularities and has shown promising results in reducing sideways spinal curvature for many clients.

## Long-Term Management and Bottom Line
Managing scoliosis is a long-term commitment. While some patients see quick improvements in symptoms, the real success lies in consistent care and monitoring. Our team works with each patient to develop personalised management plans that evolve with their progress and needs.The team at Complete Chiropractic are committed to providing evidence-based, personalised care for each patient with scoliosis. We understand that every case is unique and requires an individualised approach to treatment.

If you’re concerned about scoliosis or are seeking conservative management options, we encourage you to reach out. Our Initial Consultation process will help determine if our approach is right for your specific case.
