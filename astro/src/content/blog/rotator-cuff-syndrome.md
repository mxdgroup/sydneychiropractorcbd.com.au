Rotator cuff impingement syndrome, also known as ‘a rotator cuff injury,’ is a very common shoulder injury. Your shoulder joint is a ball and socket joint that is moved and controlled by four muscles known as the rotator cuff. The subscapularis, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and teres minor are your rotator cuff muscles that balance out and control your shoulder movement on your shoulder blade (scapula).

As the name suggests, the rotator cuff muscles are in charge of the shoulder rotation and form a cuff around the head of the humerus (shoulder ball). Overcoming this injury can take many months, and treatment should always be performed by a leading Sydney chiropractor.

Let’s dive in into all you should know about rotator cuff injury.

## Rotator Cuff Injury Symptoms
There are many symptoms of a rotator cuff injury, but the most common ones include shoulder pain that occurs when lying on your side, at rest, or when your arm is at your side or raised above your head. You might also experience shoulder weakness and a clicking sound when you move your shoulder.

While these symptoms can indicate a rotator cuff injury, a tear may present additional signs. These include severe pain, especially when lifting or lowering your arm, weakness when rotating or lifting your arm, inability to sleep on the affected side, and a crackling sensation when moving your shoulder in certain positions. If you suspect a tear, it’s crucial to consult a professional for a proper diagnosis. That may include physical tests and imaging studies like MRI or ultrasound.

## Rotator Cuff Injury Causes and Treatments
Understanding the causes can help prevent future injuries. Common causes include repetitive overhead motions (common in sports like tennis or baseball), sudden, forceful movements, falling on an outstretched arm, age-related degeneration, and poor posture or workplace ergonomics. Depending upon the harm’s seriousness, treatment will fluctuate.

If you have any kind of shoulder pain, it’s vital that you have an exam performed by an accomplished doctor. That’s because rotator cuff is crucial for control and steadiness of the shoulder. While some rotator cuff shoulder injuries are treated with rest, others may require surgery or other forms of  care.

 ## How to Fix Rotator Cuff Pain?
While severe cases may require surgical intervention, many rotator cuff injuries can be managed with conservative treatment. This can include rest and activity modification, ice or heat therapy, anti-inflammatory medications, physical therapy and specific exercises, chiropractic care for proper alignment and mobility, and in some cases, corticosteroid injections.

## Rotator Cuff Injury Exercises
Exercises play a crucial role in both prevention and rehabilitation of rotator cuff injuries. Some beneficial exercises include pendulum swing, shoulder blade squeezes, wall climbs, and internal and external rotation with a resistance band. Always seek professional treatment before starting any exercise regimen to ensure they’re appropriate for your condition.

Rotator cuff injury recovery time can vary significantly depending on the severity of the injury and the treatment approach. Minor strains or impingements may heal in a few weeks with proper care. Partial tears typically take 2-3 months of conservative treatment. Complete tears requiring surgery may take 4-6 months or longer for full recovery. It’s important to note that everyone’s healing process is unique, and following your healthcare provider’s advice is crucial for optimal recovery.
