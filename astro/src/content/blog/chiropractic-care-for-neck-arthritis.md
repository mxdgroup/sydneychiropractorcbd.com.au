Chiropractic is a rapidly growing part of conventional medicine. Focusing on the neuromusculoskeletal system, chiropractic care improves the connection between the musculoskeletal system and nervous system to treat different health ailments. This treatment involves careful neck adjustments and manipulation of the joints and other musculoskeletal structures. Luckily, chiropractors can help. The proven safety and effectiveness of chiropractic neck adjustments have led to their frequent use alongside conventional therapeutic techniques, especially in treating neck or cervical arthritis.What is Cervical (or Neck) Arthritis?Rheumatoid arthritis is a systemic inflammatory condition that may involve the cervical spine, giving rise to neck or cervical arthritis. Approximately 43-86% of individuals suffering from rheumatoid arthritis report involvement of the cervical spine. Cervical arthritis results in erosion of cervical vertebrae and ligamentous laxity.The clinical presentation may include subaxial subluxation, atlantoaxial instability, and cranial settling. Patients also tend to suffer from atraumatic odontoid fracture, neurologic abnormalities, and inflammatory discitis. If left untreated, cervical arthritis can lead to fatal complications including obstructive hydrocephalus, cardiac arrest, and stroke.Clinical Features of Cervical ArthritisNeck pain is the most common clinical manifestation of cervical arthritis. The pain usually occurs in the craniocervical region of the neck. Patients may also experience occipital headaches and ear or mastoid pain. This reflects the involvement of greater auricular and greater and lesser occipital nerves as they pass proximally to the atlas and axis vertebrae.Cervical arthritis patients may also present with signs of neurological deficit including:Muscular atrophy and weaknessLimb paresthesia (burning or prickling sensations in hands, feet, legs and arms)Bladder and/or bowel dysfunctionHyperreflexia (overactive reflexes)Spasticity (abnormal muscle tightness and spasms)Abnormal plantar and/or abdominal reflexesLoss of proprioception (body&#8217;s ability to sense movement and location)Lhermitte&#8217;s sign (&#8216;barber chair phenomenon&#8217; &#8211; electrical sensation through the back and limbs)Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing)Dysarthria (slurred speech)Tinnitus (ringing in ears)Vertigo (dizziness without movement)Visual disturbancesChiropractic Care for Cervical ArthritisChiropractic care is among the safest and most effective therapeutic modalities for neck pain and cervical arthritis. However, chiropractic adjustment is not recommended during periods of active inflammation. Chiropractors may adjust the vertebrae and surrounding tissues depending on the presenting complaints and the patient&#8217;s health status. They may use adjunctive therapies including ultrasound, electrotherapy, cold laser, and infrared sauna to relieve pain, swelling, and stiffness of cervical joints.This neck pain treatment process involves several careful steps:Initial AssessmentThorough physical examinationReview of radiologic imaging reportsIdentification of pathology siteTendon RegulationKneading motion to relax neck musclesFocus on sternocleidomastoid, splenius capitis, and splenius cervicis5-7 repetitions with tolerable forceBalancing OsteopathyPatient sits uprightChiropractor manipulates jaw and occiputHead turned in four directions (45-degree angles)Specific neck flexion based on vertebrae location:15 degrees for C1 to C30 degrees for C4 to C630-45 degrees for C7 to T1Final StepsNeck rotation (40 degrees) towards affected sideSuccess indicated by &#8216;snapping&#8217; soundsCollaterals-dredging techniqueEar helix manipulationConclusionProfessional chiropractic adjustment of the cervical spine alleviates neck pain and improves range of movement in patients suffering from cervical arthritis.
