## WHAT CAUSES NECK PAIN?

You neck is the most vulnerable part of your spine. Not only does it support your 10- to 12-pound head, maintain a gentle forward curve, and permit head rotation, but it must also allow the free flow of nerve impulses to the head, face, hands and the rest of your body. Besides discomfort and annoyance, chronic neck pain is a sign that something is wrong.

Improper telephone use is but one of the many causes of neck pain. A thorough examination can reveal its likely causes and suggest the best approach for optimum results.

Many everyday things can cause neck pain, such as watching TV, using your computer, reading a book or falling asleep in a chair or on an airplane. The temporary pain that results can’t resolve on its own, especially when the offending activity is discontinued. When it doesn’t a more serious underlying problem may be indicated.

A thorough examination can determine if you’re a good candidate for chiropractic care. These tests may involve your ability to turn and bend. Muscle tone of the supporting muscles in the neck may be tested. Diagnostic imaging to reveal the underlying structure of the spine may be requested. These and other tests are designed to identify the cause and location of your neck pain.

Your cervical spine (neck) consists of seven small interlocking bones. Neck pain can be associated with a loss of forward curve.

The most common cause of neck pain is functional distortions in the spine resulting from vertebral subluxations. These subluxations are seen in cases of reverse cervical curve, whiplash and joint disability. The body responds by tightening muscles in the neck, splinting the joint to protect it from further insult.

Most of the pain-sensing nerves in the neck are location in the pairs of facet joints on the back side of each vertebra. These smooth, interlocking surfaces allow you to rotate your head and bend your head up and down. If these joints become locked or fixated, neck pain can result. Chiropractic care can help restore proper joint motion.

While the giraffe has the same number of cervical vertebrae as you do, it lacks the gentle forward curve essential for turning and bending.

A more difficult problem to correct is the degenerative changes that result from neglect. Years of uncorrected spinal decay. These types of problems respond more slowly, and some type of ongoing supportive chiropractic care may be necessary.

Our response to stress is another common cause of neck pain. Deadlines. Rush-hour traffic. Overcommitments. Work pressures. Family obligations. . . 

Ever meet someone who was a “pain in the neck”? Each of us is susceptible to our body’s unconscious response to people and circumstances. These perceptions can show up as episodes of neck pain. Like a turtle that retracts its head in stressful situations, many people with neck pain attempt to protect their neck by involving their shoulders. 

If the weakest link in our bodies is our neck, stress shows up there. While chiropractic care cannot reduce the stress of your busy life, it can help improve your ability to handle and tolerate it. Without drugs or surgery! 

## WHY DID THE CHIROPRACTOR TAKE PICTURES OF MY LOWER BACK?

Many patients are surprised when their chiropractic examination involves other areas of their body besides the local site of their symptom(s). Some neck pain cases can be a compensation to problems in the feet, knees, hips and lower back. Your chiropractor sees you as a whole person, not just a collection of parts.”
