Many people worldwide are affected by an unfortunate condition of the spine called Scoliosis. Essentially it details a curvature of the spine, scoliosis can cause pain and discomfort to those who are afflicted with the condition.

Unfortunately, this often makes daily life a struggle due to the pain and difficulties scoliosis sufferers face when they walk, sit or partake in any activities. We, at Clinic 27, are a group of trained Sydney chiropractors who strive to help people suffering from this crippling condition. We can apply non-invasive methods to provide relief of the pains and symptoms associated to the condition.

Scoliosis consists of a curvature of the spine, caused by many different factors. The different types of scoliosis are:

- Congenital – This is caused by a bone abnormality at birth.
- Neuromuscular – Resulting from paralysis, this type of scoliosis is cause by abnormal muscles or nerves.
- Degenerative – This type is due to degenerative bone disease, extreme surgery or severe back trauma.
- Idiopathic – This is considered the most common type of scoliosis and no clear identifiable cause has been found.
Scoliosis is detected through X-Ray screenings and two of the most common treatments for the condition consist of the use of braces and invasive surgery.

## A Non-Invasive Scoliosis Treatment
Using the Advanced Bio structural Correction (ABC) Method, a Scoliosis chiropractor will hone in on the specific places in the spine where the condition is at its worst.

Small movements will then be applied to manipulate tension areas to help realign the spine. With frequent therapy sessions, the patient may see significant improvements in their overall movements, energy levels and spinal alignment. We have seen the successful recovery of many scoliosis sufferers due to our treatment, which is the most non-invasive method available in the medical field today. Individual results may vary and we suggest you make an appointment with our Chiropractor team today to discuss your specific case and see if we too may be able to help you.

## Can it be Prevented?

Scoliosis is tragic. It causes both physical pain and emotional suffering. This sideways bending of the spine shows up as abnormal posture and then finally, deformity. If allowed to advance, it can interfere with the lungs, heart and many other vital organs. 

## There is hope.

Scoliosis affects boys, but more frequently girls, between the ages of 8 and 18. The cause varies. Some are born with this spinal deviation (congenital). Others get it from assuming a distorted head or hip position (habitual). Sadly, in many cases the cause is still unknown. 

Clothing that doesn’t fit correctly can be an early sign of scoliosis. 

In the beginning, when it is easiest to correct, there are rarely symptoms. However, an alert parent may notice that a high shoulder or low hip makes clothing fit poorly. Back and leg pains may develop but are often overlooked as merely “growing pains”. Neglect is the biggest danger. 

Make sure your children use both straps on their backpacks and their load doesn’t exceed 15% of their body weight. 

Some theorise that using devices that hasten early walking may interrupt the crawling stage, essential for proper spinal development. 

If allowed to run its course, scoliosis can steadily worsen. Early detection is critical. Severe cases can involve surgery. This procedure attaches steel rods to the spine to force it to straighten. 

Chiropractic care has helped many young women avoid the unhappy effects of scoliosis. The procedure is simple. 

Surgical intervention often involved bolting a steel rod to the child’s spinal column.

First, a thorough examination helps detect scoliosis in its early stage. Then, corrective action can begin at once. The primary course of care is a program of specific chiropractic adjustments. These help improve the function and structure of the spine. Muscles strengthen. Posture can improve. 

Chiropractic care has helped countless young women reclaim their health, posture and their self-esteem. 

Scoliosis sufferers carry the burden of exhausting leg pain on a daily basis. Directly affecting the sciatic nerve, the largest nerve in the body, it is a condition that must be treated with care and attention. Unfortunately, sufferers of this crippling condition can go years without proper treatment, affecting their quality of living overall.

The team at Clinic 27 strives to tackle scoliosis with non-invasive therapies. Many patients have consulted our team of Chiropractors when other treatments have been of limited or no effect and found our treatments to look at the body as a whole rather than a specific area which may have a better outcome for their case
