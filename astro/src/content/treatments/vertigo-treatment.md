Vertigo can affect many people for a variety of different reasons. Whether the condition is chronic or stems from the onset of migraine headaches, vertigo is an unpleasant sensation that makes the most basic of daily tasks difficult to bear which is why many people seek out vertigo treatment.

There are many causes for vertigo however, some cases may be assisted with out the use of drugs and surgery and in fact Chiropractic care in some cases has been shown to be quite effective when it comes to dealing with certain types of Vertigo.¹

In many cases vertigo can be caused by an issue with the inner ear. If the function in this area is not working as the body expects it can lead to imbalance that may inhibit standing, sitting or functioning comfortably in an upright motion. Some of the most common causes of vertigo are:

Meniere’s disease – A build-up of fluid and changing pressure in the inner ear leads to this disorder
BPPV – Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo is caused by the build-up of small calcium particles in the inner ear canal

- Vestibular neuritis – An inner ear disorder usually caused by an infection
- Stroke
- Brain tumour
- Neck injury
- Back injury
- Migraines
- Certain medications

Unfortunately, the causes of vertigo are many, which makes vertigo treatment all that much trickier. Trained Chiropractors who treat vertigo, can be found in our Sydney CBD clinic.
