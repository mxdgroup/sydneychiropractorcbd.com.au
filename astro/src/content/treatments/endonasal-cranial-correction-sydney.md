## WHY ENDONASAL TECHNIQUE?
Ordinarily the body attempts to self-correct bones out of alignment, but with cranial bones lacking any such muscles for self-correction, the Endonasal Cranial Correction technique specifically targets cranial bones that are out of place. Quite often, patients present with high levels of discomfort which are relatively non specific. Through the endonasal cranial correction technique used by our chiropractors in Sydney CBD, small bones that create the structure of skull can be re-aligned in a safe and natural long-term solution. This targeted approach subsequently corrects only those bones that are misaligned and not compensatory changes that may have resulted.
