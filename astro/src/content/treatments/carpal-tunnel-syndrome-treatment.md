Carpal Tunnel Syndrome is a common ailment for many people; the prevalence in women is up to three times more likely. Females generally have a smaller carpal tunnel, a narrow passageway in the wrist, that opens into the hand. This tunnel has the bones within the wrist beneath it and a special nerve known as the median nerve runs through this area. When there is pressure on the large median nerve this can cause irritation, numbness and sometimes pain which is commonly associated with the ifk.

The non-surgical treatments include lots of rest for the affected hand, chiropractic treatments & physiotherapy, wearing a splint on the wrist and hand at night, diuretic medications to reduce fluid retention within the body, and corticosteroid injections to reduce the swelling.

## CHIROPRACTIC CARE FOR CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME

It is usually advisable to seek out non-surgical treatments for such things as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, as surgery is best left as a last resort. The compression of the nerve does not always happen at the wrist, as nerve roots are located at the spinal cord near the lower part of the neck. Treatment of the spinal cord, can, therefore, sometimes alleviate the condition. Less invasive treatments like chiropractic joint manipulation or mobilisation, stretching, and massage can be effective. In some instances, hand and wrist pain are not Carpal Tunnel Syndrome at all, but caused by something else, and may respond to spinal, tendon and joint therapy.
