Are you suffering from jaw clicking, facial pain, or persistent headaches? These symptoms may indicate temporomandibular joint disorder (TMJ) or related cranial issues.
 
At clinic 27, we now offer TMJ/Cranial chiropractic care designed to gently realign your jaw and cranium, helping restore function, relieve pain, and rebalance your nervous system.
 
Here is all you need to know about the symptoms, as well as the treatment:

## About TMJ and Cranial Dysfunction

Many individuals don’t realise how much stress they hold in their face. Facial tension can contribute to jaw pain, headaches, ear discomfort, and even affect your posture. Over time, this can also affect the skin’s elasticity—contributing to the appearance of wrinkles and facial asymmetry.

## Common Symptoms to Recognise

TMJ dysfunction doesn’t just present as clicking jaws or limited mouth opening. Symptoms may include facial pain, pressure around the eyes or cheeks, neck stiffness, and even sensations similar to Bell’s palsy, such as numbness or muscle fatigue on one side of the face.
 
After facial trauma—such as from an accident, dental procedure, or surgery—the body’s natural protective patterns can lead to further restriction in the soft tissues of the face and jaw.
This is where facial fascial release becomes essential. The fascia is the connective tissue that wraps every muscle and organ in the body, including those in the face.
 
When it becomes restricted, it can trap inflammation, limit movement, and block natural drainage pathways such as those for lymphatic flow or sinus relief.

## What Causes TMJ and Cranial Problems?

Understanding what causes TMJ issues helps in both prevention and effective treatment. Jaw misalignment (malocclusion) is a primary cause, forcing your jaw to work harder during normal functions and creating strain on the joint and surrounding muscles.

Poor posture significantly impacts jaw alignment. Forward head posture places additional stress on the jaw joint and contributes to TMJ problems by disrupting the natural alignment of your head, neck, and jaw.
 
Stress is one of the most significant contributors to TMJ dysfunction. When under stress, many people unconsciously clench their jaw or grind their teeth, placing enormous pressure on the temporomandibular joint. This stress response creates chronic tension and structural changes that perpetuate jaw pain.
 
Common risk factors include:
- Chronic teeth grinding (bruxism)
- Previous jaw injuries
- Arthritis affecting the jaw joint
- Connective tissue disorders
- Chronic stress and anxiety

Our chiropractic care addresses jaw and cranial issues through gentle, non-invasive techniques. This approach recognises the intricate relationships between the jaw, cranium, spine, and nervous system, working to restore balance throughout these interconnected structures.

During a TMJ facial release session, gentle, targeted techniques are applied to relax overactive muscles, release fascial adhesions, and improve circulation. Clients often report not only reduced pain but a softer, more lifted appearance in the face, clearer breathing, and a deep sense of calm.

## Benefits Beyond Pain Relief
The benefits of TMJ/cranial chiropractic care extend beyond simple pain relief:
- Decreased jaw pain and elimination of clicking sounds
- Relief from jaw locking episodes
- Reduction in TMJ-related headaches and migraines
- Improved jaw range of motion and function
- Better sleep quality and reduced teeth grinding
- Enhanced facial symmetry and structure improvements

Many patients also report improvements in skin vitality due to better circulation and reduced tension in facial muscles. The holistic approach addresses not just symptoms but underlying causes, leading to comprehensive improvements in comfort and function.

## What to Expect During Treatment

Treatment sessions typically involve gentle adjustments to the jaw and cranial structures, along with soft tissue work to address muscle tension. Your practitioner will provide home care recommendations to support your treatment between sessions.

At Clinic 27, Dr. Rin Choi, we approach facial release not just as a treatment for jaw problems, but as a holistic therapy for the entire face and nervous system. Whether you’re recovering from trauma, seeking relief from chronic tension, or simply wishing to age gracefully with less stress on your facial tissues—TMJ facial release may be the support you’ve been looking for.
