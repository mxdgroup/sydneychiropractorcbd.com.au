Are you suffering from jaw clicking, facial pain, or persistent headaches? These symptoms may indicate temporomandibular joint disorder (TMJ) or related cranial issues.
 
At clinic 27, we now offer TMJ/Cranial chiropractic care designed to gently realign your jaw and cranium, helping restore function, relieve pain, and rebalance your nervous system.
 
Here is all you need to know about the symptoms, as well as the treatment:

## About TMJ and Cranial Dysfunction

Many individuals don’t realise how much stress they hold in their face. Facial tension can contribute to jaw pain, headaches, ear discomfort, and even affect your posture. Over time, this can also affect the skin’s elasticity—contributing to the appearance of wrinkles and facial asymmetry.

## Common Symptoms to Recognise

TMJ dysfunction doesn’t just present as clicking jaws or limited mouth opening. Symptoms may include facial pain, pressure around the eyes or cheeks, neck stiffness, and even sensations similar to Bell’s palsy, such as numbness or muscle fatigue on one side of the face.
 
After facial trauma—such as from an accident, dental procedure, or surgery—the body’s natural protective patterns can lead to further restriction in the soft tissues of the face and jaw.
This is where facial fascial release becomes essential. The fascia is the connective tissue that wraps every muscle and organ in the body, including those in the face.
 
When it becomes restricted, it can trap inflammation, limit movement, and block natural drainage pathways such as those for lymphatic flow or sinus relief.

## What Causes TMJ and Cranial Problems?

Understanding what causes TMJ issues helps in both prevention and effective treatment. Jaw misalignment (malocclusion) is a primary cause, forcing your jaw to work harder during normal functions and creating strain on the joint and surrounding muscles.

Poor posture significantly impacts jaw alignment. Forward head posture places additional stress on the jaw joint and contributes to TMJ problems by disrupting the natural alignment of your head, neck, and jaw.
 
Stress is one of the most significant contributors to TMJ dysfunction. When under stress, many people unconsciously clench their jaw or grind their teeth, placing enormous pressure on the temporomandibular joint. This stress response creates chronic tension and structural changes that perpetuate jaw pain.
 
Common risk factors include:
- Chronic teeth grinding (bruxism)
- Previous jaw injuries
- Arthritis affecting the jaw joint
- Connective tissue disorders
- Chronic stress and anxiety
