Millions of people in the world suffer from headaches and migraines. Accidents, injuries, diets, insomnia and stressful lives are some of the leading causes of these debilitating conditions, making everyday life that much harder to manage.

A Migraine or headache can cause symptoms such as throbbing sensations on one side of the head, often accompanied by symptoms of nausea and impaired vision. It is believed that genetics and environmental factors play a role in the onset of headaches or migraines, speaking to imbalances in brain chemicals and hormones. Our Sydney CBD chiropractors offer treatment and relief if you’re suffering from such headaches or migraines.

## CAN YOU MAKE THEM GO AWAY?

There are many types and causes of headaches. Regardless of the cause, if you have a headache, you want it to end. Fast! 

This has produced a huge market for medications that cover up the symptoms of headaches. Powerful drugs can numb your nervous system so the pain doesn’t register. While these approaches may be convenient, they can cause adverse effects and kidney or liver damage. Worse, they don’t correct the underlying cause of the headache. 

Headaches may be common, but they’re not normal! 

A cause of headaches can be from spinal bones in the neck that aren’t supporting your head properly. They’re not moving right. This can affect nerves, muscles and even the blood supply to your head. 

Headaches can be related to vision problems and other causes. Our examinations can show if you are likely to be helped with chiropractic. 

Chiropractic doctors locate areas of the spine that aren’t moving properly. They notice if proper spinal curves are present. They look at your posture and your ability to turn and bend. These and many other examinations can help determine if you are likely to benefit from chiropractic care. 

Your body does not have an aspirin shortage! Medications merely numb your body, ignoring the underlying cause. 

If you’re a good chiropractic candidate, your care will consist of a schedule of chiropractic adjustments. These help normalise spinal function, help restore essential spinal curves, improve circulation and reduce nerve irritation. Many patients report fewer and less severe headaches. 

Just as the foundation affects a building, headaches and neck pain can be a reaction to problems in the pelvis or lower back. 

While we can’t guarantee results, our office has a high success rate with patients who get headaches.

Many headaches are the result of a loss of curve in the neck, affecting nerves, muscles and blood supply to the head. 

## THE DEEP-ROOTED CAUSES OF MIGRAINES

Whatever the cause, the pain is real and can often be excessive, preventing people from partaking in activities of daily living. With the onset of nausea or impaired vision, headaches can be more than a simple painful sensation. As such, many Australians are searching for headache and migraine treatment to help them get on with their day as healthily as possible.
