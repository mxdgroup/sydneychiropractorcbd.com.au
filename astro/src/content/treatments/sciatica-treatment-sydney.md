Sciatica can affect many people from all walks of life, it is often caused by a spinal disc herniation. This herniation is usually the cause of age-related degeneration due to injuries incurred. With time, and without sciatica treatment, it can worsen and have negative consequences on a person’s quality of life.

Sciatic pain can make it difficult to sleep and walk, sciatica is a debilitating condition that requires extra attention and care when treating it. The pain is usually described as a sharp shooting type, stemming from below the knee all the way down to the foot. This level of inflammation can persist for years and worsen if the area is not treated with regular therapy and care.

An experienced sciatica chiropractor can assess such a medical condition, understanding the reasons for its initial onset and the ways to prevent aggravating it further. Our team of Sydney Chiropractors at Clinic 27 are trained to diagnose and make recommendations specific to these conditions.

Our chiropractors will look at your spine, to see the issues and the injuries it is unable to correct on its own. Using a series of Chiropractic adjustments following the Advanced Bio structural Correction Method, the chiropractor may make small corrections to your spine in order to change the alignment of the body.

Being able to enjoy outdoor activities or go out for a simple walk without pain will directly improve a patient’s quality of life and we may be able to provide you the necessary treatment to help you achieve this.

## How do you get sciatica ?
It’s easy to trace some spinal problems to an event, such as a car accident. Yet, sciatica is often the result of cumulative damage. Years of bad posture, poor muscle tone, excess weight or countless other causes set the stage. Then, something simple like bending over to tie your shoes can trigger an episode

## Can anything else cause sciatica?
Spinal decay can be another culprit. Instead of disc thinning that puts pressure on the sciatic nerve roots, arthritic bone spurs can intrude into the space normally reserved for the nerve.

## Can chiropractic cure sciatica?
Actually, chiropractic doesn’t cure anything! Only your body can do that. The chiropractic approach to sciatica (and other health problems) is to help restore the way your spine works, reducing nerve irritation and revitalizing your own healing ability.

## How long will I need chiropractic care ?
Most sciatica patients are delighted with the results they get after weeks or months of care. Naturally, this varies from patient to patient. After a relapse or two, many discover that years of neglect have produced spinal instabilities that never fully heal. These patients elect to continue with periodic chiropractic checkups. It’s up to you.

## How Will I Get Relief?
Sciatica can be a distracting pain that starts in the lower back and extends down into one or both legs. Chiropractic care has proven to be quite helpful. 

 Before submitting to dangerous and irreversible surgery, more and more patients are seeking the natural approach offered by chiropractic. 

 Those suffering from sciatica are often in their 40s and 50s. It usually begins as an acute pain in the lower back and then extends down the back of either leg. The pain usually worsens with long periods of sitting or standing. 

 Like the visible part of an iceberg, symptoms are obvious. Yet there can be years of hidden and undetected spinal problems. 

 Like a large river created by smaller streams, five pairs of nerves exit the spine in the lower back to form the two sciatic nerves. The soft, pulpy disc between each spinal bone is often involved. While a disc can’t “slip,” it can bulge, herniate or rupture. This can put direct pressure on the nearby nerves. The result? Swelling. Inflammation. Pain when coughing, sneezing or with others kinds of movement. 

 Chiropractic adjustments can be very helpful in improving spinal biomechanics and reducing nerve pressure to the sciatic nerve roots. 

 Sciatica often worsens with extended bed rest. Pain pills or muscle relaxers are unable to correct the nerve compression caused by the bulging disc. Physical therapy merely works the area to increase your tolerance to pain. Surgery often involves cutting away disc tissue or removing bone to make room for the nerve. 

 Fortunately, sciatica often responds to safe, natural chiropractic care. 

 Like the changing shape of soft ice cream, a common cause of sciatica is a bulging disc that puts pressure on nearby nerves. 

 Improving joint motion with a series of chiropractic adjustments has produced results for millions. “Before” and “after” images of the lower back often show improved disc height and spacing. Many patients report that they can resume their lives and that their symptoms disappear. Without resorting to drugs or surgery.

 Your chiropractic doctor is uniquely skilled to evaluate and reduce the most common cause of sciatica nerve pain. It’s the natural approach to relief and better health. There is hope!
