# Nutrition & Wellness Workshop

Join us for our nutrition and wellness workshop where you'll discover how nutrition affects your musculoskeletal health and learn dietary strategies to support your chiropractic treatment.

Our workshops run weekly and are an integral part of your care plan to ensure you get the most out of your health investment and to make sure you are not "un-doing" too much of your spinal correction! 

Learn how to break the bad habits and instill new activities to live the active life you deserve. Our workshop is included in the cost of your first visit and as such is essential to enable us to help you achieve your goals. 

Friends and family are more than welcome to come along to our workshops and meet our chiropractors in Sydney.
