      "Family, friends, and workmates can often recommend a chiropractor they have used before. Which is always handy when searching for a chiro near you. But if you’re not lucky enough to know someone who can suggest a chiropractor to you, the next best thing is to do a quick search on Google, and judge them based on their chiropractic industry training, their years in the industry, their online review profile, and their position in Google. Because these things, more than anything else, will help you make an informed decision prior to booking in for your initial chiropractic consultation.",

      "If you are wondering, “when should I see a chiropractor near me in the Sydney CBD,” there are a few things you should know. Generally, people tend to see a chiropractor when they are experiencing chronic back pain. However, you can also see a chiropractor if you are experiencing numbness, muscle aches, digestive problems, lack of energy, tennis elbow, golfer’s elbow, sciatica, nerve pain, fibromyalgia, headaches and fatigue (to name just a few symptoms chiropractic treatments may be able to help treat)."

    description: [
      "There are those who think you should only see a chiropractor when you start experiencing chronic back pain, etc. And while this is true, there are many people who benefit from preventative chiropractic treatments, such as performed by the experienced chiropractic team at Clinic 27.",
      "Whether you’ve searched for a ‘chiropractor near me’ and attend our clinic in the Sydney CBD once, or over multiple visits, will naturally depend on your personal symptoms and underlying medical condition, as there is no ‘one size fits all’ approach to pain management."
