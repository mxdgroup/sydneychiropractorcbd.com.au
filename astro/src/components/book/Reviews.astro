      reviewText="Hooman's treatment has made a world of difference to me - hips and lower back pain have been dramatically reduced through a slow, careful, sustained series of treatments over the course of four weeks. I can highly recommend him and Clinic 27."

Angus is a true professional; always on time, answering my many queries on the what and why of adjustment and overall a friendly and personable approach. My health has greatly benefited from Angus and the team. Highly recommend."

      reviewText="I have been seeing Dr Angus Phelps since 2021. Initially it was to help with my posture. After a few adjustments I noticed a significant improvement and I've continued with maintenance adjustments. When providing treatment I found Dr Angus to be very professional, knowledgeable and caring. He listens carefully to understand what the issue is and provides treatment accordingly. I feel confident in his care and I would highly recommend him and the whole team."
